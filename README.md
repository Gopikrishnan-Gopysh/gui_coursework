Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player’s objective is to figure out a hidden word. At the start of the game, a word is chosen for the player to guess. The game is played over multiple rounds, following these steps:

The player is shown their current progress — the letters they’ve guessed correctly so far are revealed, while the remaining unknown letters are represented by dashes. (At the start of the game, the player only sees a series of dashes, one for each letter of the word.)
The player makes a guess by selecting a letter.
If the guessed letter is part of the word, it replaces the corresponding dashes in the display, and the player is notified of the correct guess.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player is informed of the incorrect guess.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (or "lives") they can use before the game ends. The player wins by successfully guessing all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses. If they fail to do so, the game is lost.
